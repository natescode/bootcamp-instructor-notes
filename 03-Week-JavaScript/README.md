# Module 03 Instructor Overview: JavaScript

## Overview

In this module, you will introduce students to the fundamentals of JavaScript, including variables, primitive types, arrays, and objects. You will also use logical and comparison operators to construct conditional statements and guide students as they write their first functions and algorithms. 

Review this module's Roadmap in Canvas for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and this module's Challenge.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* This will be some students' first introduction to programming fundamentals and the JavaScript language. Assure students that they will use the skills they learn this week again and again, and the syntax will become more familiar with practice. 

* This is also a good opportunity for students to practice pseudocoding. Encourage students to talk through difficult activities in plain language with their partner. This will help them to not only reinforce their fundamental understanding of JavaScript but also build the problem-solving skills that JavaScript demands. 

* Take a few minutes before class to familiarize yourself with the various ways to access [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/open) on different machines, so that you can talk students through opening up the console on Mac and Windows operating systems.

* The lessons this week cover a lot of new material. But each activity builds on the previous ones, so remind students that if they feel overwhelmed, they can look back at past activities for guidance. 

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related career services material can be found in the Weekly Wrap-Up in Canvas.

* If you'd like more information on career services, visit the [career services resources page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp/).

## Heads-Up

Next module, we will work with Web APIs. To preview the material, point out that students have already worked with the methods `console.log()`, `alert()`, `confirm()`, and `prompt()`. Then note that these methods are just a few of the many Web API methods available to JavaScript developers.
