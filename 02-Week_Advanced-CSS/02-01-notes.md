# Notes

## Responsive Design

_"Responsive"_ means to change to appropriately fit the given screen-size.

_"Adaptive"_ means to change to appropriately fit the given device.

## Tools of Responsive Design

### Media Queries

Media Queries ask about the current web browser: is the width a certain size?, does the user prefer dark mode?

### Display modes

`flexbox` and `grid` are powerful tool to make a website responsive.

`flexbox` is 1 dimensional. Elements wrap in columns OR rows; never both.

`grid` is 2 dimensional. One can define columns and rows. [Subgrid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Subgrid) is a newly supported feature.
