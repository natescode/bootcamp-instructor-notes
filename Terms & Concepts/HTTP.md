A pattern for communicating over the World Wide Web to server HTML files. Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.

HTTP thinks of URLs (uniform resource locator) as **nouns** and HTTP methods as **verbs**. Every website you visit in your web browser i.e. Chrome is a **GET** request. GET is the HTTP verb for asking for data. 

**GET \https://www.google.com** 

When filling out a form such as a questionnaire on a website and hit `submit` you are making a **POST** request.

| VERB   | USAGE   |
| ------ | ------- |
| GET    | read    |
| POST   | create  |
| PUT    | replace |
| PATCH  | update  |
| DELETE | delete  |
