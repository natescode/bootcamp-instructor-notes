The client-server model is a structure to how clients and servers communicate. Clients are devices that communicate and make requests to servers that give responses. 

Check [MDN's take on the Client Server Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Client-Server_overview). 

A client can be
- phone
- laptop
- car entertainment center
- GPS device
- smart watch
- IOT device
- smart fridge
- etc.

Servers are just specialized computers that respond to client requests. Servers go and get data. They're like managers. A server may talk to a database to get some data or make a request to another server (making IT the client).
