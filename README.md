This repo hold all of my notes for the 2U full-stack bootcamp. You may view these markdown files with a regular text editor or a markdown viewer. These notes are ideally viewed in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as I have each file tagged and linked with other files.

I'll do my best to keep this updated.

## Contributions

Students are welcome to contribute to this repository. Please fork this repo and make your changes in your own branch that follows the naming convention `feature/username/branch-name`. I'll review PRs every week or so.
