The Terminal seems scary at first. All a Terminal is, is a program that proves a text [[Interface]] with your computer. Most these days are used to a GUI or graphical user interface. We mostly use touch screens and graphics. Back in the day, computers weren't powerful enough to use graphics so it was just text.

## Commands

Terminal command depend on the terminal's language. We'll be using `git bash` or the default if you are on MacOS or Linux. 

### Command Commands

We can do everything, and much more with text than with graphics! If we want to view our desktop folder we can change our location (same as double clicking the folders in File Explorer or Finder).

This command will move use to the desktop (assuming Windows path here)
```shell
# Windows
cd c:\users\yourname\Desktop
# MacOs
cd Desktop
```

## Shell

Terminals will have some default programming language or shell language that is used. 

`cd`, `ls`, `touch` are all shell commands.
