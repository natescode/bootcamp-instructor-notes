Markdown is basically easy HTML. It gets translated to HTML and you *CAN* use HTML with it. This document is markdown. Markdown files end in `.md` file extension.


## Headers

```markdown
# Header 1   

// SAME AS

<h1>Header 1</h1>

## Header 2

// SAME AS

<h2>Header 2</h2>


### Header 3

// SAME AS

<h3>Header 3</h3>

```

## Links

We can link with this syntax `[Name of link](https://www.website-or-local-file-link.com)`


## Images

Images are linked almost the same as regular links (anchor tags) but with `!` prepended.

`![Image alt text](/link/to/image.jpg)`


## Paragraphs

New lines with text like this one automatically become `<p>` tags.
