## Terminals and Command lines, and Shells OH MY!

`terminal`- Terminal Emulator. Emulates a machine designed for interacting with another machine.
`command line` - a text based instead of UI based for interacting and giving commands.
`shell` - a programming language designed to talk to your operating system.
`bash` - Bourne-Again SHell is a Unix shell language.
`git` is just a program that we access via the command line that tracks text-based file changes. There are GUIs for GIT. VS Code has one and Gitkraken are my favorite.

## GIT

GIT is one of many tools in the **Source Control** or **Version Control System (VCS)** family. All GIT does is create save points of your code (text files)
that can be branched, merged and shared.
